<h2>Translation Application</h2>

This project started as a hack to translate our wordpress pages in a easy way, you can see in Spreadsheet a way to translate a WP dump using GSheet. 

We then built a translator that was using Python to produce simple translations. I show an example here.

Then we built a more ambitious, and intelligent code, that does the actual work to create a translating intelligent machine.

Then we try build our own transaltor using Google Translate Cloud.

The next thing is not translating a page anymore but using a LLM to redo the content that answer a similar question in another language.

What I show here is the architecture for a simple translation application mostly in Python.
